            <h3>World Class library</h3>
            <p>LThe school library is a place where knowledge, inspiration, imagination and creativity are nurtured.
                Academic support books, Non-Fiction and Fiction books are the hallmark of our library.

            <h3>Play Ground</h3>
            <p>The opportunity to play and play well is what we provide for at eduford. Sports are as important for the all-round development of a child as are academics. Sports inculcate a sense of responsibility, encourage team spirit, develop discipline and help the child learn to deal with success and failure equally.</p>

            <h3>Tasty and Healthy Food</h3>
            <p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p>
